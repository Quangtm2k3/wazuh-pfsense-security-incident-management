# wazuh-pfsense-security-incident-management
Final-year capstone project: Building an incident management system using Wazuh, pfSense, and ELK Stack to monitor and respond to cybersecurity threats in a virtual lab.
# üõ°Ô∏è Capstone Project ‚Äì Wazuh & pfSense Incident Management System

This is the final-year capstone project for the Information Security program at FPT University.  
The project focuses on building an incident detection and response system using:

- **Wazuh SIEM** for log monitoring and threat detection  
- **pfSense** as a firewall to control and filter network traffic  
- **ELK Stack** for centralized log management and visualization  
- **VMware** to create a virtual lab for simulating attacks

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Monitor network threats in real-time
- Detect common attacks: SSH brute-force, Trojan malware, DoS
- Automate responses: block IP, delete infected files, send email alerts
- Provide a scalable and cost-effective open-source solution for SMEs

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Wazuh
- pfSense
- ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Windows VM
- Wireshark, Hping3, Nmap, VirusTotal API
- Python (for automation)
